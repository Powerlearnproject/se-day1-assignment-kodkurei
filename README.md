Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s)
Description: The Waterfall model, introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce in the 1970s, was one of the first formalized software development methodologies. It is a linear and sequential approach where the development process is divided into distinct phases: requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Significance: This model laid the foundation for structured software development by emphasizing documentation, discipline, and a clear process flow. However, it was later criticized for its lack of flexibility, leading to the development of more iterative models.
2. The Agile Manifesto (2001)
Description: The Agile Manifesto was created by a group of software developers in 2001 as a response to the limitations of traditional development models like Waterfall. Agile emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, flexibility, and responsiveness to change.
Significance: Agile revolutionized software development by promoting a more adaptive and collaborative approach. It has become one of the most widely adopted methodologies in the industry, particularly in environments where requirements are uncertain or likely to change.
3. The Rise of DevOps (2010s)
Description: DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps emphasizes automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and collaboration between development and operations teams.
Significance: DevOps has transformed the way software is developed and deployed, promoting faster releases, improved collaboration, and more reliable software. It has become essential in modern software engineering, especially in cloud-based and large-scale environments.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis
Purpose: To gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. This phase involves working with stakeholders to understand what the software needs to do and any constraints it must operate within.
2. System Design
Purpose: To translate the requirements into a blueprint for the system. This phase involves designing the architecture, user interfaces, data models, and other components necessary to implement the software.
3. Implementation (Coding)
Purpose: To write the actual code that will form the software. Developers translate the design specifications into source code using appropriate programming languages and tools.
4. Testing
Purpose: To verify that the software works as intended and is free of defects. Testing can include unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests (UAT).
5. Deployment
Purpose: To release the software to the users or the production environment. This phase includes activities such as installation, configuration, and setting up necessary infrastructure.
6. Maintenance
Purpose: To provide ongoing support for the software after it has been deployed. This includes fixing any bugs that arise, making updates, and adding new features as needed.
7. Evaluation 
Purpose: To assess the performance of the software and the SDLC process itself. This phase can involve collecting feedback from users, analyzing performance data, and reviewing the development process to identify areas for improvement.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Overview:
Sequential and Linear: The Waterfall model is a linear approach where the development process flows in one direction through well-defined phases: Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
